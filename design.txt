parameter sets used:
mean1_range = np.arange(0, 10001, 200)
mean2_range = np.arange(0, 10001, 200)
std_dev_range = np.arange(10, 1001, 50)
simulation gives us a bimodal distribution which consists of 500 samples from each set of parameters
-- sensible ranges of parameters? one or 4 for each?

mean1_range = np.arange(0, 1001, 20)
mean2_range = np.arange(0, 1001, 20)
std_dev_range = np.arange(10, 101, 5)

method 2:
A neural network is trained on these sets of parameters and one sample for each set
dummy variables - not affect much
loss function -- aloss is sensible
for evaluation, for each set of parameters, predict the distribution with 100 samples, -- enough? 100 or 500?
and compare them with those from the simulation, assessed with four measures

method 1:
A neural network is trained on these sets of parameters and summary statistics for distributions from each set
dummy variables?
loss function?
for evaluation, for each set of parameters, predict the distribution with 100 samples, extracting summary statistics 
and compare them with those from new simulation ??, assessed with four measures

what if change sd as well?
