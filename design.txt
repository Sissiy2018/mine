parameter sets used:
mean1_range = np.arange(10, 1001, 10)
mean2_range = np.arange(10, 1001, 10)
std_dev_range = np.arange(10, 101, 10)
simulation gives us a bimodal distribution which consists of 500 samples from each set of parameters
-- sensible ranges of parameters?

method 1:
A neural network is trained on these sets of parameters and one sample for each set
dummy variables?
loss function?
for evaluation, for each set of parameters, predict the distribution with 100 samples, -- enough? 100 or 500?
and compare them with those from the simulation, assessed with four measures

method 2:
A neural network is trained on these sets of parameters and summary statistics for distributions from each set
dummy variables?
loss function?
for evaluation, for each set of parameters, predict the distribution with 100 samples, extracting summary statistics 
and compare them with those from the simulation, assessed with four measures
